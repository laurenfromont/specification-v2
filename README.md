# Beacon API specification [![](https://travis-ci.org/ga4gh-beacon/specification-v2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ga4gh-beacon/specification-v2) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification-v2/master/LICENSE)


The Beacon protocol defines an open standard for genomics data discovery, developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health. It provides a framework for public web services responding to queries against genomic data collections, for instance from population based or disease specific genome repositories.

This repository contains the specification for the *v2* major version upgrade of the Beacon API. It is now (2020) under active development and has _not_ seen a _stable_ code release.

Our partners in research and clinical settings are helping us improve version 2, who will soon be submitted for approval to GA4GH. Here are the links to default schemas:
* [Default schema (code)](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification-v2-default-schemas/releases/tag/draft.3)
